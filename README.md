# HomeLab-Setup
Demonstrates hands-on IT/cybersecurity skills gained from building a Windows homelab with Hyper-V, pfSense, and Active Directory. Deployed IDS (Snort) and tested security measures. As a CompTIA A+ candidate, this shows I'm capable of real-world IT tasks with proper guidance and continuous learning.
