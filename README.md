# HomeLab-Setup

Welcome to my IT/Cybersecurity Homelab repository! This collection of projects demonstrates my hands-on experience in building, configuring, and managing a homelab environment, showcasing practical skills in IT support, system administration, and network security.

As a candidate who has passed the CompTIA A+ exam and is actively pursuing Security+ certification by 12/31/2024, this repository reflects my ability to apply foundational IT knowledge. While I am still learning, these projects show my enthusiasm for real-world IT and cybersecurity tasks and my capability to excel with the right guidance and continuous development.



# Homelab Overview

This homelab simulates an enterprise environment using a Windows-based setup, incorporating key IT and cybersecurity concepts:

**Virtualization Setup:** Created virtual machines using Hyper-V to host various operating systems (Windows Server, Ubuntu, Kali Linux), simulating real-world multi-platform environments.
  
**Networking Configuration:** Built a virtual network using pfSense, with DHCP, DNS, and firewall rules to ensure secure, segmented network communication.

**Active Directory Deployment:** Deployed Active Directory on a Windows Server VM, creating a domain controller with users, OUs, and group policies to manage network resources and permissions.

**File Sharing and Access Control:** Configured a file-sharing service, managing user permissions to ensure proper access control and secure data handling.

**Security Tools:** Implemented Snort IDS for network intrusion detection, pfSense for firewall management, and antivirus solutions for endpoint protection.

**Penetration Testing:** Simulated network attacks using Kali Linux and Metasploit, identifying vulnerabilities and testing defenses.

**Automation & Scripting:** Automated routine tasks with PowerShell and Bash scripts, improving lab management efficiency by streamlining user creation, backups, and monitoring.



# Phase Breakdown

**Phase 1: Virtualization and VM Setup**
- Installed Hyper-V on Windows 11 Pro and created virtual machines for Windows Server, Ubuntu, and Kali Linux.
- Configured each VMâ€™s resources, network settings, and initial configurations.

**Phase 2: Networking**
- Built an internal network using pfSense, configured with custom DHCP and DNS settings.
- Established firewall rules to segment and secure network traffic between virtual machines.

**Phase 3: Active Directory and Services**
- Installed and configured Active Directory on a Windows Server VM.
- Created domain controllers, users, OUs, and group policies to manage network resources.
- Deployed file sharing services with proper permissions and access control.

**Phase 4: Security Implementation**
- Installed and configured Snort IDS to monitor network traffic for suspicious activity.
- Deployed a firewall (pfSense) and antivirus software (ClamAV) to protect virtual machines from external threats.

**Phase 5: Security Testing**
- Simulated attacks using Kali Linux and Metasploit to test the effectiveness of security defenses.
- Implemented and documented vulnerability management workflows using OpenVAS.

**Phase 6: Automation and Optimization**
- Created PowerShell and Bash scripts to automate user management, backups, and system monitoring tasks.
- Documented the impact of automation on overall lab efficiency.



# Skills Demonstrated
